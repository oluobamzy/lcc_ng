Media Management Platform

Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive media management platform with a focus on a mobile-first design, integrated with Firebase Storage for media management and YouTube for live streaming. It also includes a complete login and identity management system and a modern, high-end website UI/UX redesign.

Goals and Objectives

Build a media management system allowing administrators to upload, view, and delete media files (images, videos).

Ensure media uploads use Firebase Storage, with robust error handling and a seamless user experience.

Provide live streaming capability via YouTube integration, allowing users to view live streams directly on the website.

Implement a secure and scalable authentication and identity management system (using Firebase Auth or similar).

Deliver a premium, modern UI/UX redesign that rivals websites built with a $50k budget.

Prioritize a mobile-first design approach, ensuring full responsiveness and performance on all devices.
